# Contributing

This document includes some conventions and style for code and documentation in this repository to
improve consistency, quality, and maintainablity.

Before you submit changes, you are expected to carefully review your own changes. At a minimum, this
means testing every change manually and reading the entire diff for mistakes or obvious things that
could be improved. The lint checkers and tests do not have complete coverage.

## Using AI

If you choose to use AI tools, you are expected to carefully audit, edit, and understand any AI
generated material you submit (code, comments, documentation, bug reports, ...). You, the human
developer, are *fully* responsible for it. Remember that carelessness wastes everyone's time, not
just yours.
