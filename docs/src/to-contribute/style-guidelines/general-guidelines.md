# General Guidelines

For all text and code files:

* Use a spell checker and do basic editing on documentation and code. (There are spell checkers that
  check words that are within identifiers like `MisplledWard`. Use one.)
* Use a line length of 100. **Reason:** This is the default width used by `rustfmt` and consistent
  length makes text easier to scan.
* Use `TODO([your handle or name], [issue number or link]): description` when there is a known issue
  or future task. **Reason:** This allows searching for issues and easily finding more information
  when they are encountered.

If you encounter violations of these rules in text or code you are editing, go ahead and fix them.
