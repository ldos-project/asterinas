# Micro-benchmark kernel

This is a small OSDK kernel which performs benchmarking on OSTD operations. Having a separate kernel
avoids the complexity, overhead, and interference of running a more complete kernel like Asterinas.

TODO: As of writing, this is very minimal and requires modification to test each separate operation.
